## CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery and Deployment)

### What is CI/CD and Why do we use it? 

- CI/CD allows organisations to deliver software quickly and efficiently.
  
- CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.
- CD can refer to continuous delivery or deployment, which both automate the release and rollout of the application after merging.
- It supports the goal of agile methodology to accelerate the software development lifecycle
- Faster software builds, customer satisfaction by deploying the app in time
- Reduce risk on delivery - Testing every change before it's deployed ensures that the result will be a higher quality product and lower the rate of bugs in production.
- User feedback - enabling faster release of new features to meet users' needs. This will increase customer satisfaction 

### What is Jenkins?

- Jenkins is an automation server built to create a CI/CD environment.
- It is used to implement CI/CD workflows, called pipelines.
  
- Used to automate parts of the development process, including building, testing, and deploying applications.
- Jenkins is open source
- Build”, “Test”, and “Deploy”.

### Why Jenkins ?
