## CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery and Deployment)

### What is CI/CD and Why do we use it? 

- Continuous integration and continuous deliver/deployment are practices that automate the software release process, from build to deploy in DevOps culture
- CI/CD allows organisations to deliver software quickly and efficiently.
- CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.
- CD can refer to continuous delivery or deployment, which both automate the release and rollout of the application after merging.
- It supports the goal of agile methodology to accelerate the software development lifecycle
- Faster software builds, customer satisfaction by deploying the app in time
- Reduce risk on delivery - Testing every change before it's deployed ensures that the result will be a higher quality product and lower the rate of bugs in production.
- User feedback - enabling faster release of new features to meet users' needs. This will increase customer satisfaction
