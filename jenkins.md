# Jenkins

### What is Jenkins? 

Jenkins is an open source automation server which offers a simple way to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery environment.
<br>

It is used to continually create and test software projects, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to integrate changes to the project. For example, if your team is working on a project, Jenkins will continually test your builds and alert you any mistakes early in the process.
<br>

Organisations may use Jenkins to automate and speed up the software development process.
